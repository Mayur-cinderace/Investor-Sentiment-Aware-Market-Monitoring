The trade deal with the UK is a nothing burger being paraded around like a huge deal. The best trade situation for china-us was before the tariffs, anything that is negotiated since those tariffs cannot improve on what there was before. The dollar is steadily losing its status thanks to mangoman and that's not going to stop anytime soon because an idiot is in the driver's seat and he keeps doing ridiculous shit with his elementary school understanding of trade. He's basically signed in a recession on an economy that was only really growing in the stock market, the foundations of the us economy have been fragile for a while with bad jobs, low pay,  and the gutting of federal programs and social services will leave many more in poverty and unable to spend. It's a disaster waiting to come to the surface. "

Answer: Stock compensation, which has ballooned from $56M to $360M.

I don't think there is 1 group that can be singly to blame for the bulk of it. Older boomers who can't sell due to market, Airbnb owners, REIT rental investments. Each one of these is in single digit % owner ship of a city's housing stock, but add them all up and it starts to be a real %.

The one single faction to blame is human nature. We can all see that someone has to lose, but none of us want to be the one to do it. That is the only reason we are in a gridlock and the only way it unsticks itself is if someone is forced to lose."

https://archive.ph/D2pIv


Retail has become a kind of balancing mechanism for the market because it doesn't have risk controls (or even awareness).


However it has also lead to huge skew in the market with popular stocks very expensive, retail heavy stonks completely unanchored and unpopular stocks undervalued. Price discovery barely happens anymore: stocks trade on news events not fundamentals and narratives are simplistic, first order thinking.


Works great until it doesn't. TSLA is the poster child: the stock keeps going up even as the fundamentals are collapsing. Very soon one the biggest stocks in the world will be loss making with declining sales and guidance but a significant amount of global capital will be tied up in it's shares. How does that resolve? I don't know but I suspect it will give the whole market indigestion."

I am the ultimate degenerate.  Drug addict who quit heroin in 2011.  No college education despite going twice.  Bullshit jobs I always get promoted at fast but make no real money because I fucked up.  Then I inherited some money and got into stocks.  I was a real pussy at first dabbling my toes with $1000 on a pennystock.  Made money, great.  Eventually found potstocks and Canada was about to legalize.  What a genius investment, I thought!  A black market going clean so known sales and who wouldn't prefer to go to a clean shop with tons of choices.  Cue fast money made and then faster money lost.



A while later covid hits.  Down from like $220k to $28k.  Potstock portfolio was always one US legalization rumor away from being saved.  But it never happened.  Trump, Biden, Trump, no legalization, no pump, always down.  But Aphria decided to merge with Tilray and you fucks for some reason got on the bandwagon.  Maybe it's because TLRY was originally a low float stock that got pumped insanely.  I don't really know or care but it fucking saved my ass.  In the depths of covid despair I gave up all my shares and everything I had for LEAPS believing in this shit because I can't give up a fucking bad thesis apparently.  The TLRY pump got APHA up hundreds of percent and my options were intraday worth about $450,000.  I had sell orders in literally all fucking day.  But I put them in a bit high and it kept climbing, so like a greedy fucking goblin I moved my orders up.  Eventually the day ended with a down move, though still quite green iirc.  I never got out.

  
This ended up in my biggest single day loss.  $124k.  This was after my biggest one day win of just shy of 100k.  I don't remember exactly when I got out but it must have been nearly immediately the next day for fear of not being made whole again from my goddamn recklessness.

  
So I've rode it up and down and then to answer the question - I changed dramatically.  No more single stock concentration, especially if it were to be options related.  I never want to be that exposed again."

You expose yourself to a lot of unsystemic risk (risk that can be eliminated with diversification) when you only invest in one stock. I'm glad you got lucky this time, but you could very easily have lost almost your entire portfolio. 

Investing in something like a total market index fund will have much higher risk-adjusted returns. Not only will the expected returns be higher (since there are lower transaction fees and short term call options already have low expected returns) , but your risk will also be lower. Traditional finance theory would suggest you want to maximize returns for any given risk level, but you are doing the opposite--minimizing expected returns at an extremely high level of risk."

Going long on SPY is just going to be extremely risky, and you will not be compensated for that risk. Small cap stocks are risky, for example, but they have higher expected returns, so you get compensation. But just straight SPY options are not a good idea."

Those ships aren't sailing. Once the crap hits the fan and a week or so later donnie finally makes a deal with china they need to spin up factories, load up ships, get those ships sailing. Then those ships need to be unloaded onto trains and trucks before getting to a Walmart. There were ships 4-6 weeks into their journey when the tariffs started that completed their journey and the stores are still getting stocked from that. But the ports are empty. Are they going to lay off the dock workers that operate the cranes that unload the ships, or are those people going to find other work when they've been furloughed and need to make money. Do you think it's quick and easy to train people to do that job? What about truck drivers that start quitting en-masse due to work shortages for a few weeks. 

  
It is a multi-month journey from Chinese factory to Walmart shelf. There were things already in the pipeline, that's why it seems like there isn't a shortage. 

  
IDK why this is so hard for people to grasp. At the very least this will be an ""air bubble"" in the pipeline of supply, the longer we stop putting stuff in that pipe and have things shut down the longer we will deal with that one way or another, it's just a delayed reaction on our end.

  
So even if the deal is in 1 month, the damage is already done, and will continue to be done. We could make a deal with China tonight and there will still be supply disruptions."
